# Farming Game Helper

This React app was built to help play the Farming Game. It is deployed on [Netlify here](https://farming-game-helper.netlify.app/).

## Version 1.0.1

1.0.0 - 9/26/2021 - Calculate your harvest income with a randomly generated Operating Expense. Current Operating Expenses are only number values 500-3000.

1.0.1 - 10/3/2021 - Added ability to double or cut in half your harvest.

1.1.0 - 10/28/2021 - Expanded the operating expense calculations to include calculations for not having a tractor, harvestor, and your debt. Also added ability for OP to be based on your crop acres. This OP is based on the crop being HARVESTED not total acres of the farm! This update came with some reworking of the code that sets it up for further growth with the OP function being in a seperate file.


## Development Goals

- Add character trackers for each person playing.

- Add a virtual die for harvest rolls (?).

- Build cards to add players. Each card will keep track of the players acres, debt, and doubles. You will then be able to click calculate for any individual player for a given crop and it willtake care of the rest.
